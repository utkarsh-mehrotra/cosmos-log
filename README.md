## How it works

1. **Scheduled Run**: A GitHub Actions workflow runs every day at 6 AM UTC (or manually via workflow_dispatch).
2. **Fetch Data**: A Python script runs to fetch the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA's API.
3. **Format & Commit**: The script updates this README, creates or updates a monthly log file in the `/log` directory, and pushes the latest entry directly to the repository.

## Setup

1. Push these files to a new GitHub repository called `cosmos-log`.
2. Go to your repository's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
3. Create a new repository secret named `NASA_API_KEY` and paste your NASA API key. (You can register for a free key at [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/)). Alternatively, it will use the `DEMO_KEY` with strict rate limits.
